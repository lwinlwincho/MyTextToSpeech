        TextToSpeech API : Synthesizes speech from text for immediate playback or to create a sound file.
        A TextToSpeech instance can only be used to synthesize text once it has completed its initialization.
        Implement the TextToSpeech.OnInitListener to be notified of the completion of the initialization.
        When you are done using the TextToSpeech instance, call the shutdown() method to release the native
        resources used by the TextToSpeech engine.
